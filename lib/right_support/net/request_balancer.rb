  # Utility class that allows network requests to be randomly distributed across
  # a set of network endpoints. Generally used for REST requests by passing an
  # Array of HTTP service endpoint URLs.
  #
  # Note that this class also serves as a namespace for endpoint selection policies,
  # which are classes that actually choose the next endpoint based on some criterion
  # (round-robin, health of endpoint, response time, etc).
  #
  # The balancer does not actually perform requests by itself, which makes this
  # class usable for various network protocols, and potentially even for non-
  # networking purposes. The block passed to #request does all the work; the
  # balancer merely selects a suitable endpoint to pass to its block.
  #
  # PLEASE NOTE that it is VERY IMPORTANT that the balancer is able to properly
  # distinguish between fatal and non-fatal (retryable) errors. Before you pass
  # a :fatal option to the RequestBalancer constructor, carefully examine its
  # default list of fatal exceptions and default logic for deciding whether a
  # given exception is fatal! There are some subtleties.

    # retry:: a Class, array of Class or decision Proc to determine whether to keep retrying; default is to try all endpoints
    # fatal:: a Class, array of Class, or decision Proc to determine whether an exception is fatal and should not be retried
    # on_exception(Proc):: notification hook that accepts three arguments: whether the exception is fatal, the exception itself,
    #   and the endpoint for which the exception happened
    # health_check(Proc):: callback that allows balancer to check an endpoint health; should raise an exception if the endpoint
    #   is not healthy
    # on_health_change(Proc):: callback that is made when the overall health of the endpoints transition to a different level;
    #   its single argument contains the new minimum health level
